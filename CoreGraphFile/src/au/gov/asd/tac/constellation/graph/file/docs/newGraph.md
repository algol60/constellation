## New Graph

Clicking the "File → New → New Simple Graph" menu item will generate a
new empty graph in the Constellation window.  
These graphs will have a minimal set of node and transaction
attributes.  
  
There may also be a selection of other graph types which add additional
functionality over the Simple Graph.
