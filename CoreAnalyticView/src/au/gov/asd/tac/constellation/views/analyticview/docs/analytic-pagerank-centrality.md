# Pagerank Centrality

In graph theory, centrality is any measure that determines how
structurally important a node is within a graph.

Pagerank Centrality is a measure of a nodeâ€™s importance calculated by
counting the number and quality of incoming transactions. The assumption
is that important nodes are more likely to receive transactions from
other nodes.
