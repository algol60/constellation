Click the **OK** button to execute the merge operation.  

### Identifying the merge nodes

By default, all of the nodes are selected for merging. The selected
nodes are marked in the table by the check box in the left-most column.
Any node can be excluded/included from the merge operation by either
clicking in the checkbox or using the **Include All** or **Include All**
actions in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.  
  
The total number of selected nodes is displayed in the lower right-hand
corner of the panel.

### Identification of attributes

By default, the final merge node will get a copy of all the attributes
of the first node listed in the table.  
Clicking an individual cell in each column will identify the attribute
values to be copied to the merged node. Alternatively, clicking an
**ID** value will select all the attributes values of the given row.
