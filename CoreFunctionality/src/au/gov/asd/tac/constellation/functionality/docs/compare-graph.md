# Compare Graph

## Compare two graphs and show the differences in a new graph

Compare Graph can be accessed via Tools -&gt; Compare Graph

Compare Graph does a comparison of two open graphs and shows the
differences in a new graph. An output window will also displayed with
descriptions of the differences. Possible detected differences are
additions, deletions, and attribute value changes.

In the new graph, each node and transaction will be coloured according
to the change detected. An attribute will also be added called Compare
with value set to whatever change was detected (Added, Removed,
Modified, or Unchanged).
